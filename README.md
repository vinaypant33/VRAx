**Vrax** is a lightweight, custom-built UI library for creating applications with minimal dependencies, designed for developers who want full control over their UI components. The library provides a custom, low-level implementation that allows you to create and manage windows, handle native events (mouse and keyboard), and render UI elements like buttons, labels, and more without relying on external frameworks like Tkinter or Pygame.

The core design of **Vrax** is focused on providing developers with the flexibility to build their own UIs while retaining full control over the rendering process. Whether you're building a simple application or a complex one, **Vrax** gives you the tools to design and control your application's user interface from scratch. It also includes a basic event-handling system, enabling you to manage user inputs like mouse clicks and keyboard events efficiently.

**Vrax** is still in development, and the current features include window creation, event handling, and basic UI components like buttons and text labels. As development continues, more features such as custom widgets, layout systems, and advanced rendering capabilities will be added.

The library is open for contributions, and anyone interested in contributing is encouraged to fork the repo, open issues, and submit pull requests. For any inquiries or suggestions, feel free to contact me at [vinaypant24@gmail.com](mailto:vinaypant24@gmail.com). The documentation is in progress, and updates will be available soon. Stay tuned for future enhancements and features!
